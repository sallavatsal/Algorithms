Sorting Algorithms - It's Permutations.

Classification:-
1) Time Complexity: Measure of rate of time taken by algorithm w.r.t. input size
2) Space Complexity or Memory usage: 
     * In-place: Use constant amount of extra memory to rearrane
     * Extra memory to temporarily use data which grows with input size
     * Stability: Cards (C-Club; S-Space; D-Diamond; H-Heart)
          6C, 9S, 3D, 6H        // Unsorted
          3D, 6H, 6C, 9S        // Sorted but NOT Stable
          3D, 6C, 6S, 9S        // Sorted & Stable
     * Internal Sort vs External Sort:
          Internal: All records in Main Memory / RAM
          External: All records in disks/tapes
     * Recursive or Non-Recursive:
          Recursive: Quick Sort & Merge Sort
          Non-Recursive: Insertion Sort & Selection Sort
